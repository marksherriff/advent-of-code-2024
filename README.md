Advent of Code 2024 Notes
-------------------------

__Day 1:__ Pretty fun, even though I caught shade for using an n^2 algorithm....

__Day 2:__ I have no idea why my algorithm for part 2 wasn't working.  I caught the index of each report where it failed and then tested removing either side of that failure.  If a list only has "one bad number," I figured this should work.  It didn't.  So screw that - I'm brute forcing it.

__Day 3:__ I hate figuring out regex.  But this one was pretty simple in the end.
